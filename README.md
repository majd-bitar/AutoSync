<!-- project philosophy -->
<img src="./readme/title2.svg"/>

> A mobile app and web platform for car diagnostics, making it easier for mechanics to monitor and maintain vehicles.
>
> AutoSync streamlines the car diagnostics process by providing a user-friendly platform for mechanics to access real-time data and communicate with clients. We aim to improve automotive service by saving time and ensuring vehicle health and customer satisfaction.

### User Stories
- As a mechanic, I want to monitor real-time car diagnostics, so I can quickly identify and address issues.
- As a mechanic, I want to communicate with clients through the platform, so I can provide updates and recommendations.
- As a client, I want to see my car's diagnostic data on the app, so I can stay informed about its condition.
- As a client, I want to receive maintenance reminders, so I can keep my car in optimal condition.

###  AutoSync is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - 🚨 Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
